# Breast Cancer Classification using Deep Neural Network 🧠

A deep learning-based classification project that predicts **whether a tumor is benign or malignant** using the Breast Cancer dataset from Kaggle. This repository contains a complete workflow for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation using a Deep Neural Network (DNN).

### 📌 Dataset
This project uses the **Breast Cancer Dataset** from Kaggle, which is structured for binary classification tasks and includes clinical measurements associated with breast tumors.

## 📋 Project Overview

The goal of this notebook is to build an automated system that can classify breast tumors as **benign** or **malignant** based on features like mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, and fractal dimension. This task leverages a Deep Neural Network trained end-to-end on the dataset.
